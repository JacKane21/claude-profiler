# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Security updates are provided for the latest released version only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately.

If that is not available, open a public issue and request a private channel
for disclosure.

We will acknowledge receipt and work with you to resolve the issue promptly.
