# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Security updates are provided for the latest released version only. If there are
no releases, the latest commit on the default branch is considered supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately.

Preferred option:
- Open a private GitHub Security Advisory (if the repository is hosted on GitHub).

If that is not available, open a public issue and request a private channel
for disclosure.

Please include:
- Affected version or commit
- Impact and severity
- Steps to reproduce (or a proof of concept)
- Any suggested fix or mitigation

We aim to acknowledge receipt within 5 business days and will work with you to
resolve the issue promptly.
